NDQ_018363,"Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence. A: The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect. According to Daltons atomic theory, all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms. Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions, no matter how small the sample of the compound. Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound. ",one piece of evidence for the theory in question 3 is the observation that,all objects have mass.,all objects have gravity.,light travels as waves or particles.,a compound always has the same proportions of different elements.,3
NDQ_018367,"A: The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect.
