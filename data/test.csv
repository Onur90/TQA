NDQ_001025,"Did you ever hear this riddle? Question: Why did the woman go outdoors with her purse open? Answer: Because she expected some change in the weather! Weather is always changing. One day might be cold and cloudy. The next day might be warm and sunny. Even on the same day, the weather can change a lot. A beautiful morning might be followed by a stormy afternoon. Why does weather change? The main reason is moving air masses.  An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout. Air masses take on the conditions of the area where they form. Winds and air currents cause air masses to move. Moving air masses cause changes in the weather. A front forms at the boundary between two air masses. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts. Clouds, precipitation, and storms commonly occur along fronts. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low air pressure. An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high air pressure.

One day might be cold and cloudy. The next day might be warm and sunny. Even on the same day, the weather can change a lot. A beautiful morning might be followed by a stormy afternoon. Why does weather change? The main reason is moving air masses.  An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout. Air masses take on the conditions of the area where they form. Winds and air currents cause air masses to move. Moving air masses cause changes in the weather. A front forms at the boundary between two air masses. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts. Clouds, precipitation, and storms commonly occur along fronts. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low air pressure. An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high air pressure.

The first major adaptation that evolved in land plants was vascular tissue. This type of tissue helped land plants cope with dryness. Vascular plants also evolved true stems, roots, and leaves. Some vascular plants evolved seeds. This freed them from needing water to reproduce. Early seed plants produced naked seeds in cones. Some seed plants evolved flowers for the production of seeds. Flowers contain both male and female repro- ductive organs, including an ovary where eggs form and seeds develop. Flowers also attract pollinators. The most basic division of modern plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones (gymnosperms) and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers (angiosperms).

Despite this variation, there are a number of traits that are shared by all animals. What traits do all animals share? Read on to find out.  Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. They are heterotrophic, meaning that they consume other organisms. Animals have specialized cells and often higher levels of organization. This allows them to do things that other eukaryotes cannot, such as move and digest food internally. Animals generally have a simple life cycle. The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain. The Animal Kingdom, in turn, is divided into almost 40 modern phyla. The Animal Kingdom can also be divided into two basic groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Most animal species are invertebrates, which lack a backbone.

The baby turtles must make their way back to the water, hopefully without being snatched up by a predator. Loggerhead turtles are reptiles. Unlike amphibians, turtles and other reptiles can lay their eggs on dry land. Thats because they produce amniotic eggs. Amniotic eggs have waterproof membranes to prevent them from drying out.  Reptiles are a class of ectothermic, four-legged vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. They include turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. Reptiles were the first vertebrates to live full time on land, and they evolved many terrestrial adaptations. Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. They lay eggs on land and generally do not provide parental care. Reptile hatchlings look like miniature adults. They lack a larval stage and do not go through metamorphosis. There are over 8200 living species of reptiles. They are classified in four orders: Crocodilia, Sphenodontia, Squamata, and Testudines. Reptiles live in a wide range of habitats.

NDQ_013368,"Did you ever use a bicycle pump like the one in Figure 15.1? The pump forces air into a tire through a small hole. Like other fluids (both liquids and gases), air can flow and take the shape of its container. The air that enters the tire from the pump quickly spreads out to fill the entire tire evenly. As the tire fills with air, it feels firmer. Thats because the air exerts pressure against the inside surface of the tire.  All fluids exert pressure because their particles are constantly moving at random in all directions and bumping into things. Pressure can be represented by the equation: Pressure = Force Area . The SI unit for pressure is the 2 pascal (Pa), which equals 1 N/m . Two factors that affect the pressure of fluids are depth and density. This explains why water pressure is greater deeper in the ocean and air pressure is greatest at sea level. Denser fluids, such as water, exert more pressure than less dense fluids, such as air. Pascals law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. This law is the basis of hydraulic equipment, such as hydraulic car lifts.

This explains why water pressure is greater deeper in the ocean and air pressure is greatest at sea level. Denser fluids, such as water, exert more pressure than less dense fluids, such as air. Pascals law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. This law is the basis of hydraulic equipment, such as hydraulic car lifts. Bernoullis law states that pressure in a moving fluid is less when the fluid is moving faster. This law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift.
