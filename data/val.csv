But gravity also causes erosion directly. Gravity can pull soil, mud, and rocks down cliffs and hillsides. This type of erosion and deposition is called mass movement. It may happen suddenly. Or it may occur very slowly, over many years.  Gravity can pull soil, mud, and rocks down cliffs and hillsides. This is called mass movement. The most destructive types of mass movement are landslides and mudslides. They occur suddenly and without warming. They engulf everything in their path. Two other types of mass movement are slump and creep. They usually arent as destructive as landslides and mudslides. Slump is the sudden movement of large blocks of rock and soil down a slope.

NDQ_000824,"Why is Earth the only planet in the solar system known to have life? The main reason is Earths atmosphere. The atmosphere is a mixture of gases that surrounds the planet. We also call it air. The gases in the air include nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Along with water vapor, air allows life to survive. Without it, Earth would be a harsh, barren world.  Gases in the atmosphere are needed by living things. They protect life from the Suns harmful rays. They also keep temperatures in a range that can support life. Gases in air play a major part in the water cycle, weather, and weathering. They are also needed to transmit most sounds. Nitrogen and oxygen make up about 99 percent of the air. Argon and carbon dioxide make up much of the rest. The air also contains water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from place to place. Air has mass and volume. It also has density and exerts pressure. Both the density and pressure of air decrease with altitude.

How did this eruption occur? Why arent all volcanoes explosive, like Mt. St. Helens? Why did so many people die if we knew that it was going to erupt?  Volcanoes are produced when magma rises towards the Earths surface because it is less dense than the surrounding rock. Volcanic eruptions can be non-explosive or explosive depending on the thickness of the magma. Explosive eruptions happen with thick magma and produce tremendous amounts of material ejected into the air. Non-explosive eruptions mostly produce various types of lava, such as aa, pahoehoe and pillow lavas. Some signs that a volcano may soon erupt include an increase in earthquakes, surface bulging and released gases that can be monitored by scientists.

NDQ_008062,"When you see an organism that you have never seen before, you probably group it with other, similar organisms without even thinking about it. You would probably classify it on the basis of obvious physical characteristics. For example, if an organism is green and has leaves, no doubt you would classify it as a plant. How would you classify the organisms in Figure 2.15? They look quite similar, but scientists place them in very different categories. The organism on the left is a type of fungus. The organism on the right is an animal called a sponge. In many ways, a sponge is no more like a fungus than you are.  Scientists classify living things to make sense of biodiversity and who how living things are related. The science of classifying living things is called taxonomy. Linnaeus introduced the classification system that forms the basis of modern classification. Taxa in the Linnaean system include the kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Linnaeus also developed binomial nomenclature for naming species. More recently, scientists have added the domain to the Linnaean system of classification. The domain is a broader taxon than the kingdom. There are three widely recognized domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Viruses lack many traits of living things so the majority of scientists do not classify them as living organisms.

You can also explore the structures in the interactive animal cell at this link:  The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids. It encloses the cytoplasm and controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cytoplasm consists of watery cytosol and cell structures. It has several functions. The cytoskeleton is the skeleton of the cell. It helps the cell keep its shape. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and other organelles. They include the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticu- lum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, lysosomes, andin animal cellscentrioles. Each type of organelle has a special function. Plant cells have several structures not found in animal cells. They include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts.

This is a special type of cell division. The cell divides twice, called meiosis I and meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates just once. Homologous chromosomes separate. The outcome is four haploid cells. Asexual reproduction has the advantage of occurring quickly. Sexual reproduction has the advantage of creating genetic variation.

NDQ_014625,"Has this ever happened to you? You walk across a carpet, reach out to touch a metal doorknob, and get an unpleasant electric shock (see Figure 23.1). The reason you get a shock is because of moving electric charges. Moving electric charges also create lightning bolts and the electric current that flows through cables and wires.  Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. Positive and negative particles attract each other. Particles with the same charge repel each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. A charged particle can attract or repel other, nearby particles without touching them because it is surrounded by an electric field. This is a space around the particle where it exerts electric force on other particles. Objects become charged when they transfer electrons. This can happen through friction, conduction, or polarization. Although electrons are transferred, the total charge remains the same. Polarization may cause a buildup of charges on an object known as static electricity. Static discharge occurs when the built-up charges suddenly flow from the object. An example of static discharge is lightning.  ",A buildup of electric charges on an object occurs because of,static electricity.,static discharge.,electric current.,polarization.,3
